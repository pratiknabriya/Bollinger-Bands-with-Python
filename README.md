# Bollinger Bands®

Bollinger Bands® are a technical analysis tool developed by John Bollinger for generating oversold or overbought signals. Bollinger Bands® are envelopes plotted at a standard deviation level above and below a simple moving average of the price. Because the distance of the bands is based on standard deviation, they adjust to volatility swings in the underlying price.

There are three lines that compose Bollinger Bands: A simple moving average (middle band) and an upper and lower band. The upper and lower bands are typically 2 standard deviations +/- from a 20-day simple moving average(can be modified to suit the User startegy).
